## What is constructor ?
- We define a constructor inside a class to intialize an object.
- A constructor is a special method of a class.
- A constructor is like a non static method but without any return type.
- Construter name must be same as your class name.
- Constructer never use any modifier.
- We can define a constructor with any access specifier.
- In java we can call the constructer implicitly by using new key word.

## Types of constructer
- Non parameterized constructer 
- Parameterized constructer.
## Q1. Is the default and non parameterized constructer are same ?
- No they are different because when the programmer not define any constructer inside the class and call the non parameterized constructer to construct an object is treated as default constructer in java.
- Default constructer is defined by public access specifier or no access specifier.
- When the programmer define the no parameterized constructer with in the class and call an non parameterized constructer for constructing an object is tread as non parameterized constructer in java.
